Drop in the diced celery, carrot, cucumber and grapes and mix well. Once all the ingredients have been combined, add additional mayonnaise if you prefer a wetter consistency to the salad.Once the consistency is right, add in curry powder and turmeric powder. These are they key ingredients, so make sure you are using high quality spices. Start with a small amount of each spice and gradually add to taste - the measurements here are just recommendations, you should taste test as you go along. If possible, pop your mixing bowl into the fridge for an hour to let the flavors marry.",
